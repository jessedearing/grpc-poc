# GRPC Proof of Concept

## Go
The `golang` directory has both a client and server. You need to have Go 1.7
installed because it uses vendoring for support.

You can use `make` to build the client and the server.

## Node
The `node` directory has a client and server.

`npm install` and `node client.js` or `node server.js` will start client and
server.

## Mix and match
You can use the Go client and the Node server or vice versa or both Node and Go.

Have fun!
